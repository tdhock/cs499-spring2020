K-fold cross-validation for hyper-parameter tuning and model comparison

In this project your goal is to implement K-Fold cross-validation,
then use it with machine learning algorithms to (1) train
hyper-parameters and (2) compare prediction accuracy.

For this project it is strongly encouraged to use R packages
data.table and ggplot2 for data reading and visualization, [[file:2.R][See
example/demo R script]] and additional code below:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## install package if it is not already.
  if(!require("data.table")){
    install.packages("data.table")
  }

  ## attach all functions provided by these packages.
  library(data.table)
  library(ggplot2)

  ## download spam data set to local directory, if it is not present.
  if(!file.exists("spam.data")){
    download.file("https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.data", "spam.data")
  }

  ## Read spam data set and conver to X matrix and y vector we need for
  ## gradient descent.
  spam.dt <- data.table::fread("spam.data")
  N.obs <- nrow(spam.dt)
  X.raw <- as.matrix(spam.dt[, -ncol(spam.dt), with=FALSE]) 
  y.vec <- spam.dt[[ncol(spam.dt)]]
  X.sc <- scale(X.raw) #scaled X/feature/input matrix.

  ## compute and visualize validation error as a function of number of
  ## neighbors.
  result <- NearestNeighborsCV(X.sc, y.vec)
  ggplot()+
    geom_line(aes(
      neighbors, error.percent, group=validation.fold),
      data=validation.error)

  ## compute and visualize test error results:
  err.dt.list <- list()
  ## assign folds.
  for(test.fold in 1:5){
    ## split into train/test sets.
    for(algorithm in c("baseline", "1-NN", "NNCV")){
      ## run algorithm and store test error.
      err.dt.list[[paste(test.fold, algorithm)]] <- data.table(
	test.fold, algorithm, error.percent)
    }
  }
  err.dt <- do.call(rbind, err.dt.list)

  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      error.percent, algorithm),
      data=err.dt)
#+END_SRC

*** Algorithm/function: KFoldCV

The goal of this exercise is to code the K-Fold Cross-Validation
algorithm.
- (10 points) You should code a function KFoldCV which should take as
  input arguments:
  - X_mat, a matrix of numeric inputs (one row for each observation, one column
    for each feature).
  - y_vec, a vector of binary outputs (the corresponding label for each
    observation, either 0 or 1).
  - ComputePredictions, a function that takes three inputs
    (X_train,y_train,X_new), trains a model using X_train,y_train,
    then outputs a vector of predictions (one element for every row of
    X_new). To provide a function with a compatible argument list, 
    you probably will need to write a wrapper around some other function,
    e.g. wrap_knn <- function(X_train,y_train,X_new)class::knn(X_train,X_new,y_train)
    See [[https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R/][Software carpentry R function tutorial]] for more info.
  - fold_vec, a vector (same size as y_vec) of integer fold ID numbers (from 1 to K, repeated many times).
- (5 points) The function should begin by initializing a variable
  called error_vec, a numeric vector of size K, to be filled with the
  mean validation error for each fold.
- (20 points) The function should have a for loop over the unique
  values k in fold_vec (should be from 1 to K). During each iteration
  k you should
  - first define X_new,y_new based on the observations for which the
    corresponding elements of fold_vec are equal to the current fold
    ID k. (new=either validation or test set)
  - then define X_train,y_train using all the other observations.
  - then call ComputePredictions and store the result in a variable
    named pred_new.
  - then compute the zero-one loss of pred_new with respect to y_new
    and store the mean (error rate) in the corresponding entry of
    error_vec.
- (5 points) At the end of the algorithm you should return
  error_vec.

*** Algorithm: NearestNeighborsCV

- (5 points) You should code a function NearestNeighborsCV with input
  arguments
  - X_mat, a matrix of numeric inputs/features (one row for each
    observation, one column for each feature).
  - y_vec, a vector of binary outputs (the corresponding label for each
    observation, either 0 or 1).
  - X_new, a matrix of numeric inputs/features for which we want to
    compute predictions. (when you call this function in the context
    of KFoldCV, X_new will be the test data matrix)
  - num_folds, default value 5.
  - max_neighbors, default value 20.
- (5 points) randomly create a variable called validation_fold_vec (same number of entries as observations in y_vec/X_mat), a
  vector with integer values from 1 to num_folds. e.g. validation_fold_vec <- sample(rep(1:num_folds, l=nrow(X_mat)))
- (5 points) initialize a variable called error_mat, a numeric matrix
  (num_folds x max_neighbors).
- (5 points) There should be a for loop over num_neighbors from 1 to
  max_neighbors.
- (5 points) Inside the for loop you should call KFoldCV, and specify
  ComputePreditions=a function that uses your programming language's
  default implementation of the nearest neighbors algorithm, with
  num_neighbors. e.g. [[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html][scikit-learn neighbors in Python]],
  [[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/class/versions/7.3-15/topics/knn][class::knn in R]]. Store the resulting error rate vector in the
  corresponding column of error_mat.
- (5 points) Compute a variable called mean_error_vec (size
  max_neighbors) by taking the mean of each column of error_mat.
- (5 points) Compute a variable called best_neighbors which is the
  number of neighbors with minimal error.
- (5 points) Your function should output a list with elements for
  (1) the predictions for X_new,
  using the entire X_mat,y_vec with best_neighbors; (2) the
  mean_error_vec for visualizing the mean validation error; 
  (3) anything else that may be relevant, e.g. the error_mat values for plotting the validation error for each fold.

*** Experiments/application
- Use spam data set from
  [[https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html]]
- First scale the inputs (each column should have mean 0 and variance
  1). You can do this by subtracting away the mean and then dividing
  by the standard deviation of each column (or just use a standard
  function like scale in R).
- (10 points) Use NearestNeighborsCV with the whole data set as the training inputs (X_mat/y_vec). The point is to plot the validation error, so it doesn't matter what you use for X_new (use 0 or 1 observation for speed).
- (10 points) Plot a bold line for the mean validation error, and draw
  a point to emphasize the minimum.
- (10 points) Randomly create a variable test_fold_vec which is a
  vector with one element for each observation, and elements are
  integers from 1 to 4. In your report please include a table of
  counts with a row for each fold (1/2/3/4) and a column for each
  class (0/1). 
- (10 points) Use KFoldCV with three algorithms: (1) baseline/underfit
  -- predict most frequent class, (2) NearestNeighborsCV, (3) overfit
  1-nearest neighbors model. Plot the resulting test error values as a
  function of the data set, in order to show that the
  NearestNeighborsCV is more accurate than the other two
  models. Example:

*** Grading rubric (out of 120 points)

Your final grade for this project will be computed by multiplying the
percentage from your [[file:group-evals.org][group evaluations]] with your group's total score
from the rubric above.

Your group should submit a PDF on BBLearn. 
- The first thing in the PDF should be your names and student ID's
  (e.g. th798) and a link to your source code in a public repo
  (e.g. github, there should be no code in your PDF report).
- The second thing in the PDF should be your group evaluation scores
  for yourself and your teammates.

Extra credit: 
- 10 points if your github repo includes a README.org (or README.md
  etc) file with a link to the source code of your GradientDescent
  function, and an explanation about how to run it on the data sets.
- 10 points if in your plot of validation error versus number of
  neighbors, you include a separate line for each fold (in addition to
  the bold mean line requested above).
- 10 points if you run your GradientDescent function through KFoldCV
  as well, and show results for that as another algorithm in your test
  error figure.
- 10 points if you compute and plot ROC curves for each (test fold,
  algorithm) combination. Make sure each algorithm is drawn in a
  different color, and there is a legend that the reader can use to
  read the figure. Example:

[[file:1-ROC.PNG]]
  
- 10 points if you compute area under the ROC curve (AUC) and include
  that as another evaluation metric (in a separate panel/plot) to
  compare the test accuracy of the algorithms.
  
** FAQ

- Given only 2 data points (or any even number), how do you make sure the algorithm functions properly?  For example, with 2 nearest neighbors, if one neighbor is 0 and the other is 1, how do we predict the current value? Given an even number of neighbors in binary classification, there is a possibility of a tie. In that case there are various rules for breaking the ties (e.g. select one of the classes at random, select the most frequent class in the train data) and hopefully it doesn't matter which rule you use. One of them should be implemented in whatever library function you are using (e.g. class::knn in R uses the random selection).
- for making data tables to visualize using ggplot2 you may want to use [[http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/animint2-manual/Ch17-appendix.html#list-of-data-tables][the list of data tables idiom]].
